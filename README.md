# Conway's Game of Life

This solution for Conway's Game of Life focuses on time efficiency for calculating iterations of the game's state.
The intent is to replace normal conditionals with faster mechanisms (pointer arithmetic, loookup arrays, etc.)

This is a work in progress, the current solution is lacking in design and will be abstracted into seperate files.
Additionally, commenting is currently incomplete, the main algorithm needs better explaining.
